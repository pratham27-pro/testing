TESTING COMPONENTS

There're basically 2 things to test for components-
1. How they render:
Components should render correctly under various conditions. If a component has props, we should pass different props and verify that it renders correctly.

2. How they respond to user actions:
We should simulate different events like the clicks or keyboard inputs and verify that they are reacting for the same as expected.

**Test the Behavior and Not the Implementation**
