Unit test - They verify the correctness of individual units or components of an application in isolation. These units could be fns, classes or even small modules.

Integration Test - They verify how the different components of the application works together as a whole and with each other. These include data flow problems, compatibility issues or communication between modules.

End-to-End Test - They are the broadest type of test which tests the entire application as a whole.
** E2E tests simulate user interactions with the entire system.


Test-driven Development:
1. Start by writing a failing test.
2. Write just enough code to make the test pass.
3. Refactor if necessary.

**TDD produces code that is 100% covered by the tests.
**TDD prevents us from over-engineering things.
